# Carl's 'custom' circuitpython-circuitplayground_express

It isn't that custom. The flashing instrucitons are from:

* https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython

With the following 3 files:

* adafruit-circuitpython-circuitplayground_express-3.1.2.uf2
* cpx_touch_pixel_rainbow.py
* README.md

## The files came from here:
* https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/download/3.1.2/
* https://github.com/kattni/Welcome_to_CircuitPython_CPX
* https://github.com/CarlFK/cpx

## Getting started
```
cpx_touch_pixel_rainbow.py is saved as code.py
code.py gets run when the board is rebooted.
The board reboots every time you write to it.

Edit code.py, hit save and see what happens!
```
