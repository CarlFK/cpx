## Carl's 'custom' circuitpython-circuitplayground_express

It isn't that custom - it has the following 3 files put on it:

adafruit-circuitpython-circuitplayground_express-3.0.0.uf2
cpx_touch_pixel_rainbow.py
README.md

The files came from here:
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython
https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/download/3.0.1/adafruit-circuitpython-circuitplayground_express-3.0.1.uf2

cpx_touch_pixel_rainbow.py is saved as code.py
code.py gets run when the board is rebooted.
The board reboots every time you write to it.

Edit code.py, hit save and see what happens!
